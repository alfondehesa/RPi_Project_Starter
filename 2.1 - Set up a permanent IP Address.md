## Summary

- Every time your **Pi reboots** or **disconnects**, your **router** will **assign it a different IP address** that you will need to find in order for you to connect to it. It is **highly recommended you set up a static IP** for your Pi, so this does not happen.
- **Local IP addresses** are **assigned at the moment the device connects** to the network by the router. This means that if, for whatever reason, at the moment of the Raspberry Pi connecting to the network, this **IP address is already taken up by something else**, or the router decides it is best to assign a different one, the **Raspberry Pi will get assigned a different IP address** than it might have had previously.
- This makes things **much more complicated**, as you would have to **keep track of your Pi's changing IP every time it reconnects** to the network.
- We can **ask your router to reserve one IP address** for your Pi, to always give it the same one.

## Assigning a static IP address (Router Side)

- [ ] **Connect** to your router.
  > [!NOTE]
  > *To do this, type `192.168.1.1` or `10.0.0.1` in a browser's address bar, depending on your router's architecture.*
- [ ] Input your **username and password**.
  > [!NOTE]
  > *If you haven't changed them, they will have a default user and password. You can find that by googling online your router's model, or it is sometimes found on a tag underneath the router itself.*
- [ ] Every router is different, but **look for a setting similar to "static IPs" or "reserve address" or "reserve IP"**, and enable it for your Pi.
- [ ] **Save** the changes.

## Assigning a static IP address (Pi Side)

Alternatively, you can also **prompt the Pi to attempt to always ask for the same IP address**. This is **less reliable**, as it is not guaranteed that that IP will be free and available in your network. Nevertheless, it **never hurts to set it up** as an added precaution.

- [ ] On the Pi's command prompt (you can connect through SSH locally), **run**: `sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf`.
- [ ] This opens up a **file that specifies the static IP settings of your Pi**.
- [ ] You need to **uncomment (remove the hash) the following lines**:

  ```bash
  interface NETWORK 
  static ip_address=STATIC_IP/24
  static routers=ROUTER_IP 
  static domain_name_servers=DNS_IP
  ```

  - **The interface should be whichever interface you are using to connect to the network**, usually `wlan0` for Wi-Fi, but can be `eth0` for Ethernet connections. **Replace `NETWORK` for that** if it isn't already.
  - `STATIC_IP` should be replaced by whichever **IP you want your Pi to demand**.
  - `ROUTER_IP` should be the default gateway IP of your browser. You can find that, on a Windows machine, by typing `ipconfig` on a terminal window, and on the Wi-Fi network section, looking for **gateway IP address**.
  - `DNS_IP` typically is the same as the **gateway IP address**.
- [ ] `Ctrl + O` and then `Enter` to **save**.
- [ ] `Ctrl + X` to **close**.
- [ ] **Restart** your Pi (you can run `sudo reboot`), and if the IP address is available, **your Pi should have the IP address you specified**!

## Next Steps

- After setting up a static IP address, you might want to access your Pi from **outside your network**.

  - For instructions on how to do so, visit [2.2 - Remote SSH (from anywhere)](2.2%20-%20Remote%20SSH%20(from%20anywhere).md).

- Alternatively, you can start installing packages.
