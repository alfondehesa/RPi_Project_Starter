## Summary

### GitHub actions

- **GitHub actions** are a useful tool that can **perform commands upon acting on your repository**.

- **Triggers** for these commands include merging to main, pushing, pulling, issuing, or approving pull requests, committing, and more.

### Self-hosted vs. GitHub hosted

- These commands can run either on your **own device** (in our case, our Raspberry Pi) or on **GitHub servers** (GitHub lends you a device that runs the commands).

- If running on **GitHub**, it will consume **computational minutes**, which is a measure of how long the action took to run and how costly it was for GitHub's servers.

- As of now, free accounts get **1000 minutes per month**, which is sufficient for the vast majority of users.

### On this page

- This guide will walk you through how to set up a **GitHub action to update a local main branch of a repo** (on a Raspberry Pi) **every time a user pushes or merges code into the main branch** from any device.

- It will save you from having to do a pull operation every time new code is available on your local machine, and can do it so do don't even have to connect to the device through SSH to update its local repo.

### The methods

- There are two ways of achieving this. We could run the action on **GitHub**, with commands that will issue **SSH commands to our Raspberry Pi** to pull code. However, this will consume minutes, and if the Pi is offline, it will simply **not work**.

- Instead, we are going to run the actions **directly in our self-hosted runner** (Pi), which will not be dependent on SSH. This also means that if the Pi is offline, GitHub will **still attempt to have the runner run the actions** for up to 30 days, meaning if at any point the Pi comes back online, it will download the new code.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> There is an edge case where, if the Raspberry Pi remains turned on and not connected to a network for more than 30 days, it will not have automatically pulled changes that happened more than 30 days ago. This can simply be remedied by either pushing a new change to the repo, or restarting the Raspberry Pi. Alternatively, you can always pull the repository manually through SSH.

## Set up the self-hosted runner

- [ ] **Connect to your Pi** through SSH.

- [ ] Using `mkdir [DIRECTORY_NAME]`, **create a directory of your choice where you are going to hold all your runners**. I like to keep my runners in `~/auto_update/runners`.

- [ ] Inside this repository, create a new folder for this specific runner using `mkdir [REPO_NAME]`. Name it the same as your repository. Navigate to this new directory using `cd [REPO_NAME]`.

- [ ] On your **GitHub repo's website**, go to **settings**, **actions**, **runners**, **New self-hosted runner**, and pick your **Pi's operating system** (it will most likely be Linux with ARM64).

- [ ] Follow the **instructions** on the **guide**.

>[!NOTE]
> *It is advised that you keep the name of your runner the same as your repository name, to be able to keep track of the specific runner's purpose.*

- [ ] You may choose to **start the runner now with** `./run.sh`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Repeat this section for every repository** that you want to self update in the Pi.

## Set up the GitHub action

- [ ] In your **repository**, go to **actions**.

- [ ] **Click** on *Set up a workflow yourself*

- [ ] On the new action file, **paste**:

```YAML
# This workflow causes a self-hosted runner (Execution Server) to either clone or pull (depending on relevance) the latest version of the repo's main branch.
# It is triggered by a push to the main branch.
name: Self Updater
on:
  push: # Trigger
    branches: [ main ] # Relevant branches (add more by adding a comma and listing: [main,dev,etc]) 
jobs:
  update: # Attempt to update the repo  
    runs-on: self-hosted # Run in self hosted runner
    env: # SETTINGS
      GITHUB_EMAIL: "yourown@email.com"
      GITHUB_USERNAME: "yourownusername"
      LOCAL_DIR: YOUR_REPO_LOCAL_PATH # CHANGE TO YOUR LOCAL REPO PATH (INCLUDE REPO MAIN FOLDER: PATH/REPO)
      REPO_NAME: YOUR_REPO_NAME # CHANGE TO THE NAME OF YOUR REPO
      REPO_ADDRESS: YOUR_REPO_WEBSITE_ADDRESS.git # CHANGE TO THE ADDRESS OF YOUR REPO WITH A .git IN THE END
    steps: 
      - name: Clone # Attempt to clone in case repo is not installed
        continue-on-error: true # If repo is installed, it will throw an error
        run: |
          sudo git config --global user.email $GITHUB_EMAIL
          sudo git config --global user.name $GITHUB_USERNAME
          mkdir $LOCAL_DIR 2> /dev/null # Attempt to make a repo folder if non existent
          cd $LOCAL_DIR # Navigate to folder
          cd .. # Navigate to root folder
          sudo git clone $REPO_ADDRESS 2> /dev/null # Attempt to clone repo
          sudo git config --global --add safe.directory $LOCAL_DIR # Add as safe directory
          sudo chmod -R 777 $REPO_NAME # Grant all permissions to all users
      - name: Pull # If previous step fails, attempt to pull changes from git
        continue-on-error: true # If repo has just been cloned, it will throw an error
        run: |
          sudo git config --global user.email $GITHUB_EMAIL
          sudo git config --global user.name $GITHUB_USERNAME
          cd $LOCAL_DIR # Navigate to existing local repo folder
          sudo git config --global --add safe.directory $LOCAL_DIR # Add folder as safe directory if it wasn't already
          sudo git checkout main # Checkout main branch
          sudo git reset origin/main # Reset all local changes to main to resolve conflicts (WARNING: THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY LOCAL CHANGES)
          sudo git reset --hard HEAD # Reset all local changes to main to resolve conflicts (WARNING: THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY LOCAL CHANGES)
          sudo git pull origin main --ff # Pull latest main branch from git
          cd .. # Navigate to root folder
          sudo chmod -R 777 $REPO_NAME # Grant all permissions to all users
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Change `GITHUB_EMAIL`, `GITHUB_USERNAME`, `YOUR_REPO_LOCAL_PATH`, `YOUR_REPO_NAME`, and `YOUR_REPO_WEBSITE_ADDRESS`, for your **email**, **username**, **own repo's path**, **name**, and **GitHub website address** respectively. **Leave the quotes `""` for the email and username only**.

- [ ] **Save and commit** the file.

- [ ] Try it out yourself by pushing something! You can see if the action was **successful** on the actions tab. Keep in mind your runner needs to have started first.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Repeat this section for every repository** that you want to self update in the Pi.

## Set up the git pull shell scripts

In the event that your Pi has been **offline for more than 30 days**, we will need to tell your Pi to try to **pull the latest version of your repo** at boot. We can do this with a **shell script** (a bunch of bash commands, just like you would type at the Pi's terminal).

- [ ] In a directory of your choice, **create a folder named `boot_scripts`**. We will use this folder to hold all the scripts we will want to **run at boot**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > *It is recommended you use the same root folder where the folder containing all your runners is located. In this case, the folder directory would be `~/auto_update/boot_scripts`.*

- [ ] We need to **create a `sh` script for every repo we want to self-update**, so **repeat the following steps** for every repo:

  - [ ] Create a new SH file, **run**: `nano your_repo_name.sh`
  > [!WARNING]
  > For consistency, it is **highly recommended** you name this file the **name of your repository**, verbatim.

  - [ ] **Paste** the following:

  ```BASH
  GITHUB_EMAIL="Change this text"
  GITHUB_USERNAME="Change this text"
  LOCAL_DIR=Change_this_text
  REPO_ADDRESS=Change_this_text
  REPO_NAME=Change_this_text

  sudo git config --global user.email $GITHUB_EMAIL
  sudo git config --global user.name $GITHUB_USERNAME
  mkdir $LOCAL_DIR 2> /dev/null
  cd $LOCAL_DIR
  cd ..
  sudo git clone $REPO_ADDRESS 2> /dev/null
  sudo git config --global --add safe.directory $LOCAL_DIR
  sudo chmod -R 777 $REPO_NAME
  cd $LOCAL_DIR
  sudo git config --global --add safe.directory $LOCAL_DIR
  sudo git checkout main
  sudo git reset origin/main
  sudo git reset --hard HEAD
  sudo git pull origin main --ff
  cd ..
  sudo chmod -R 777 $REPO_NAME
  ```

  - [ ] Set `LOCAL_DIR` to the **local directory** of your repo.

  - [ ] Set `REPO_NAME` to the **repository name** of your repo.

  - [ ] Set `REPO_ADDRESS` to the **website address** of your repo, **followed by a `.git`**.

  - [ ] Set `YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL` to the **email for your GitHub** account, and **leave the quotes** (i.e. "`alfondehesa@hotmail.com`").

  - [ ] Set `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` to the **username** you use for GitHub, and **leave the quotes** (i.e. `alfondehesa`)

  - [ ] `Ctrl + O` and `Enter` to **save**, and `Ctrl + X` to **close**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Create a SH file for every repository** that you want to self-update.

## Consolidate all shell scripts into one script

Now, we need a file that will attempt to **run all the files of all the repos we want to self-update**. This is done so at boot, we only have to **call one file**, instead of multiple.

- [ ] Create a new SH file, **run**: `nano boot_main.sh`

  - [ ] **For each SH file you created during the previous step**:

    - [ ] Add the **following lines**:

    ```BASH
    cd path/to/your/self/hosted/runner
    sudo ./svc.sh start
    sudo sh PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SH_FILES/NAME_OF_SH_FILE_FOR_REPO_1
    ```

    - [ ] Change `path/to/your/self/hosted/runner` for the **path to your repository specific self-hosted runner** that you installed in the first step (in the context of my preferred location, it would be `/home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/auto_update/runners/[REPO_NAME]`).

    - [ ] Change `PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SH_FILES` for the **path of the folder where you keep all the repo specific SH scripts** (in the context of my preferred location, it would be `/home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/auto_update/boot_scripts`).

    - [ ] Change `NAME_OF_SH_FILE_FOR_REPO_1` for the **name of the repo specific SH script** (in the context of my preferred location, it would be `[REPO_NAME].sh`).

  - [ ] **Keep adding lines for each file referring to each repo**. For three repos, it should look like this:
  
  ```BASH
  cd path/to/your/self/hosted/runner-1
  sudo ./svc.sh start
  sudo sh PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SH_FILES/NAME_OF_SH_FILE_FOR_REPO_1

  cd path/to/your/self/hosted/runner-2
  sudo ./svc.sh start
  sudo sh PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SH_FILES/NAME_OF_SH_FILE_FOR_REPO_2

  cd path/to/your/self/hosted/runner-3
  sudo ./svc.sh start
  sudo sh PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SH_FILES/NAME_OF_SH_FILE_FOR_REPO_3
  ```

  - [ ] `Ctrl + O` and `Enter` to **save**, and `Ctrl + X` to **close**.

- [ ] Confirm everything is working, by **turning off the self-updating action** on the GitHub's website, **committing a change to main**, and **running**: `sudo sh PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SH_FILES/boot_main.sh` (in the context of my preferred location, it would be `sudo sh /home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/auto_update/boot_scripts/boot_main.sh`).

- [ ] Your **repositories** should now be **up-to-date**.

## Set up the reboot logic

Now, we will tell the Pi that each time it reboots, it should r**un the logic to update its repositories**.

### Create a parent script

We will create a new file that runs the `boot_main.sh` file out of which we will set up the `systemd` service. This file will **not need to be updated every time we want to add a new repo** to self update in the future, as its only purpose will be to **run the file that is in charge of running every repo update** and turn on the runners. By setting this up now, we **prevent having to update the boot service every time we want to add a self updating repository** in the future.

- [ ] On a directory of your choice, **create a new directory**: `mkdir boot_service && cd boot_service`.

> [!NOTE]
> *It is recommended you use the same root folder where the folder containing all your runners and the folder containing all your repo specific sh files is located. In this case, the folder directory would be `~/auto_update/boot_service`.*

- [ ] Create a new **shell script file**, that runs the `boot_main.sh`, **run**: `nano boot_service.sh`

- [ ] Copy the **following lines**:

```BASH
#!/bin/bash
sudo sh path_to_sh_file/boot_main.sh >> /tmp/auto_update_boot.out
```

> [!NOTE]
> *This will log the output of the boot script to a file in the `tmp` directory of your Pi.*

- [ ] **Replace** `path_to_sh_file` by the **path to the of the directory where you created the repo specific shell scripts** (in the context of my preferred location, it would be `/home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/auto_update/boot_scripts`).

- [ ] `Ctrl + O` and `Enter` to **save**, and `Ctrl + X` to **close**.

- [ ] To be used by `systemd`, we need to make the file **executable**. **Run**: `sudo chmod +x boot_service.sh`

## Set up the `systemd` service

We now need to make it a **service to run at boot**, after the network has been connected, and a ping is successful.

- [ ] Create a **new service**, **run**: `sudo systemctl edit --force --full boot_service.service`

- [ ] Copy and paste the **following lines**:

```BASH
[Unit]
Description=Self Updating Repo Service
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=YOUR_USER_NAME
WorkingDirectory=YOUR_BOOT_SERVICE_PATH
ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c 'until ping -c1 google.com; do sleep 1; done;'
ExecStart=YOUR_BOOT_SERVICE_PATH/boot_service.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- [ ] Before saving, **change** `YOUR_USER_NAME` to your **username**, and `YOUR_BOOT_SERVICE_PATH` to the **path where `boot_service.sh` is housed** (in the context of my preferred location, it would be `/home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/auto_update/boot_service`).

- [ ] `Ctrl + O` and `Enter` to **save**, and `Ctrl + X` to **close**.

- [ ] **Load and start** the new service, **run**: `sudo systemctl enable boot_service.service && sudo systemctl start boot_service.service`.

- [ ] **Restart** the system, **run**: `sudo reboot`.

## Test it out

- [ ] **Deactivate a self updating GitHub action** on the [GitHub's website](https://github.com/).

- [ ] **Unplug** your Pi.

- [ ] Make a **change** to the main branch of your repo on [GitHub's website](https://github.com/).

- [ ] **Plug in** the Pi, verify the changes are in the Pi.

- [ ] Otherwise, you might want to **check your `tmp` folder for an error log**.

## Next Steps

- Add a **local repository to self update** to an already set up self updating Raspberry Pi.

  - Go to [5.3 - Add a repo to self update](5.3%20-%20Add%20a%20repo%20to%20self%20update.md).

- Alternatively, you can skip the previous step and go straight to **setting up your IDE**.

  - Go to [6 - Set up your IDE (VSC)](6%20-%20Set%20up%20your%20IDE%20(VSC).md).

- [Back to README](README.md).
