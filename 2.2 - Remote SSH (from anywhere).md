# 2.1 - Remote SSH: Access your Pi from anywhere

You might also want to **work on your project when traveling or not at home**, and you might need to interface with the Pi remotely to do so. This guide goes over how to **connect to the Raspberry Pi through SSH remotely, from anywhere in the world**.

## Summary

### What is a local IP

- When you connect to your **network**'s router, it assigns your device a **local IP** within your **network**. It likely has the shape of `192.168.1.XXX` or `10.0.0.XXX`. This IP is an **address for every device connected** to your **network**, and is assigned by your **router** every time you **connect to the network**. It is essentially used to track down who is who and where to send the info and from where.

- Your router also has an **IP address** as it is a device in your **network**, and it is usually the first one (`192.168.1.1` or `10.0.0.1`).
  
- These types of **IP addresses** are only **local**, meaning when you type `192.168.1.XXX` in your address bar in a browser, you are talking to **whatever device in your network that got assigned the IP address** `192.168.1.XXX`. If you are in a different network, however, (connected to a different router), typing the same will connect you to a **different device**, that has the **same local IP address** in the new **network** you are in.

### What is a public IP

- In contrast, each **router** (or network) has a **public IP address**. This **public IP** is used to connect to **networks anywhere in the world** through the internet.
It would then make sense that to connect to one device somewhere in the world, you would first need the **public IP address** to connect to the **network where this device is located**, and then the **local IP address** to connect to the **particular device** in the network.

- If having trouble visualizing this, consider the following analogy. Imagine you want to talk to a specific person, whose name is `Luke`. `Luke`'s name, in this case, is the person's `local IP`. You can find `Luke`'s in many houses, anywhere in the world. So first, you attempt to call the `Luke`'s Family's house, whose `phone number` is equivalent to the `public IP address`. Then, you would ask `Luke`'s parent (the router) to transfer you to whomever you want to talk to, in this case, `Luke` (`local IP`), and then you get to talk directly to `Luke`.

- This works the same way for **networks**. In this case, when connecting to your **public IP** from somewhere in the world, you will **specify a port number**. You will have also previously told the router that this particular **port number** routes straight **into your Pi**. And so connecting to your **public IP address** through this port will have the router route you straight into whichever **address your Pi has locally**.

### What is a DNS (Domain Name System)

- Services, like **google.com**, have servers (that you connect to when you visit them) that might **constantly change**, or have **multiple**.
  
- If, instead of connecting to google.com, you had to connect to an **IP address** that brings you to **Google's servers**, you would constantly have to keep track of which **IP** is currently the right one, and alternatively, it would be really hard to remember **hundreds of long number strings** for every service or website you frequent.

- To get around this, your browser uses a **DNS service**, which is essentially the **internet's phone book**. It is a publicly available list that relates each **literal website** address (such as google.com or facebook.com) to a **public IP address**. When you type in something like "google.com", your browser asks the **DNS** where "google.com" leads, and the **DNS** returns a **public IP** (like "73.454.324.12"), which your browser connects to **download the website**.

- Any time **Google** needs to change their servers, they change the **Public IP Address** in the **DNS** that corresponds to the **address: google.com**, so you, as a user, don't need to worry about keeping track of **IP Addresses**.

- Although it would be possible to connect to your router anywhere in the world by just typing your **public IP address** (which you can find by, while being connected to the network, typing in Google "what is my public IP address"), this address might change due to your **Internet Service Provider**, or by you moving, or many other reasons.

- For that reason, it is a good idea to use a **DNS service** (registering your **public IP** as a **literal website address**, so that you or others can easily navigate to it using a browser).

- For this, we will use **[DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/)**, which is a free **DNS service**.

## Set up a DNS service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step is not **necessary**, but **recommended**.

- [ ] Go to **[DuckDNS's website](https://www.duckdns.org/)**.

- [ ] **Sign in**, or **create an account** if you don't have one.

- [ ] On the "**Domains**" page, put a **name for your domain**, and click "**Add domain**".

- [ ] On the domain listing, under **current IP**, enter your **public IP**.
  > [!NOTE]
  > *You can look up on Google "*what is my public IP*", but you have to be **connected to your network** to do this.*

- [ ] Click on **Update IP**.

- [ ] You have successfully set up a domain for your own network! Now, typing in `https://whateverdomainyouused.duckdns.org` on any browser will take you **straight to your network**!

  > [!NOTE]
  > *If you try to do that now, you will most likely either not see anything, or see your router's login page, as we haven't told your router what to do with new connections yet.*

## Port forwarding

We can now **connect to our network**, by using either our **public IP**, or our newly established **domain address**. However, the **router** still does not know to route us to the **Pi**. This step will guide you through doing so through **port forwarding**.

- [ ] Connect to your **router**.
  > [!NOTE]
  > *Type `192.168.1.1` or `10.0.0.1` in a browser's address bar, depending on your router's architecture, while being connected to your network.*

- [ ] Input your **username** and **password**.
  > [!NOTE]
  > *If you haven't changed them, they will have a default user and password. You can find that by googling online your router's model, or it is sometimes found on a tag underneath the router itself.*

- [ ] Every **router** is different, but look for a **port forwarding**, or **port pass-through**, or **port opening**, or **port trigger** setting in your **NAT** settings.
  > [!NOTE]
  > *Here, you will find rules that tell your router how to handle specific connections form outside networks.*

- [ ] Add a **rule** to tell your **router** to send you to your **Pi** when connecting to a specific **port number**:
  
  - [ ] Select `TDC_UDP` as the **protocol**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > *If unable, you might need to add two rules, one for `TDC` and one for `UDP`.*

  - [ ] For the **external port**, pick one of your choice, like `10000`. This is the **port** you will use to be **forwarded to your Pi**.

  - [ ] For the **local IP address**, pick your **Pi's local IP address**.
    > [!WARNING]
    > **It is strongly recommended having set up a static IP address for your Pi. For a guide on how to do so, visit [2.1 - Set up a permanent IP Address](2.1%20-%20Set%20up%20a%20permanent%20IP%20Address.md).**

  - [ ] For the **internal port**, pick port `22`.
    > [!NOTE]
    > *This is the local port usually utilized for SSH.*

- [ ] **Save**, and **restart the router**.

## Test it out

> [!NOTE]
> *You can be connected to the same network (we will just be coming in from an outside connection).*

- [ ] On a **command window**, run:
  - `ssh [WHATEVER_USERNAME_YOU_SET_UP_FOR_SSH_OR_DEFAULT]@[EITHER_PUBLIC_IP_OR_YOUR_DOMAIN_ADDRESS] -p [WHATEVER_EXTERNAL_PORT_NUMBER_YOU_SET]`.

  - *It should look something like this:* `ssh monalisa@myowndomain.duckdns.org -p 10000`.

- [ ] If the Pi asks you for your **password**, congratulations!!! You just set up a **remote connection**.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see a **connection refusal**:
  
  - It means either the Pi is **not set up** to **SSH**, or you are connecting to something **other than the Pi**.

  - **Make sure that the port 10000 is going to your Pi's IP address**.
  
- If you see a **connection timeout**:

  - It means you are **not reaching any device**.

  - Make sure your **domain settings are correct**.
  
- To verify if it should be working, you can always try to **connect locally**:
  - Run: `ssh [WHATEVER_USERNAME_YOU_SET_UP_FOR_SSH_OR_DEFAULT]@[PI_LOCAL_IP] -p [WHATEVER_EXTERNAL_PORT_NUMBER_YOU_SET]` in a terminal.
  - Do not keep the crochets `[]` when changing the values.
