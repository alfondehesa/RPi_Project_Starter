# 5.3 - Add a repo to self update

Once you have completed the [**initial setup on your Pi**](5.2%20-%20Set%20up%20a%20self%20updating%20local%20repository.md), adding a **self-updating local repo** is slightly **simpler**. This guide will walk you through how to **add an existing GitHub repository to self update** on your **Raspberry Pi**.

## STEP 1: Set up a new self-hosted runner

- [ ] **Connect to your Pi** through SSH.

- [ ] Inside the repository where you keep all the runners (most likely called `runners`), create a new folder for this specific runner using `mkdir [REPO_NAME]`. Name it the same as your repository. Navigate to this new directory using `cd [REPO_NAME]`.

- [ ] On your **GitHub repo's website**, go to **settings**, **actions**, **runners**, **New self-hosted runner**, and pick your **Pi's operating system** (it will most likely be Linux with ARM64).

- [ ] Follow the **instructions** on the **guide**.

>[!NOTE]
> *It is advised that you keep the name of your runner the same as your repository name, to be able to keep track of the specific runner's purpose.*

- [ ] You may choose to **start the runner now with** `./run.sh`.

## STEP 2: Set up the GitHub action

- [ ] In your **repository**, go to **actions**.

- [ ] **Click** on *Set up a workflow yourself*

- [ ] On the new action file, **paste**:

```YAML
# This workflow causes a self-hosted runner (Execution Server) to either clone or pull (depending on relevance) the latest version of the repo's main branch.
# It is triggered by a push to the main branch.
name: Self Updater
on:
  push: # Trigger
    branches: [ main ] # Relevant branches (add more by adding a comma and listing: [main,dev,etc]) 
jobs:
  cloning: # Attempt to clone the repo, in case a version is not already in local  
    runs-on: self-hosted # Run in self hosted runner
    env: # SETTINGS
      GITHUB_EMAIL: "yourown@email.com"
      GITHUB_USERNAME: "yourownusername"
      LOCAL_DIR: YOUR_REPO_LOCAL_PATH # CHANGE TO YOUR LOCAL REPO PATH (INCLUDE REPO MAIN FOLDER: PATH/REPO)
      REPO_NAME: YOUR_REPO_NAME # CHANGE TO THE NAME OF YOUR REPO
      REPO_ADDRESS: YOUR_REPO_WEBSITE_ADDRESS.git # CHANGE TO THE ADDRESS OF YOUR REPO WITH A .git IN THE END
    steps: 
      - name: Clone # Attempt to clone in case repo is not installed
        continue-on-error: true # If repo is installed, it will throw an error
        run: |
          sudo git config --global user.email $GITHUB_EMAIL
          sudo git config --global user.name $GITHUB_USERNAME
          mkdir $LOCAL_DIR 2> /dev/null # Attempt to make a repo folder if non existent
          cd $LOCAL_DIR # Navigate to folder
          cd .. # Navigate to root folder
          sudo git clone $REPO_ADDRESS 2> /dev/null # Attempt to clone repo
          sudo git config --global --add safe.directory $LOCAL_DIR # Add as safe directory
          sudo chmod -R 777 $REPO_NAME # Grant all permissions to all users
      - name: Pull # If previous step fails, attempt to pull changes from git
        continue-on-error: true # If repo has just been cloned, it will throw an error
        run: |
          sudo git config --global user.email $GITHUB_EMAIL
          sudo git config --global user.name $GITHUB_USERNAME
          cd $LOCAL_DIR # Navigate to existing local repo folder
          sudo git config --global --add safe.directory $LOCAL_DIR # Add folder as safe directory if it wasn't already
          sudo git checkout main # Checkout main branch
          sudo git reset origin/main # Reset all local changes to main to resolve conflicts (WARNING: THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY LOCAL CHANGES)
          sudo git reset --hard HEAD # Reset all local changes to main to resolve conflicts (WARNING: THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY LOCAL CHANGES)
          sudo git pull origin main --ff # Pull latest main branch from git
          cd .. # Navigate to root folder
          sudo chmod -R 777 $REPO_NAME # Grant all permissions to all users
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Change `GITHUB_EMAIL`, `GITHUB_USERNAME`, `YOUR_REPO_LOCAL_PATH`, `YOUR_REPO_NAME`, and `YOUR_REPO_WEBSITE_ADDRESS`, for your **email**, **username**, **own repo's path**, **name**, and **GitHub website address** respectively. **Leave the quotes `""` for the email and username only**.

- [ ] **Save and commit** the file.

- [ ] Try it out yourself by pushing something! You can see if the action was **successful** on the actions tab. Keep in mind your runner needs to have started first.

## STEP 3: Set up the git pull shell script

In the **same directory where you housed all the other repository specific scripts** (most likely called `boot_scripts`):

- [ ] Create a new SH file, **run**: `nano your_repo_name.sh`

> [!WARNING]
> For consistency, it is **highly recommended** you name this file the **name of your repository**, verbatim.

- [ ] **Paste** the following:

```BASH
GITHUB_EMAIL="Change this text"
GITHUB_USERNAME="Change this text"
LOCAL_DIR=Change_this_text
REPO_ADDRESS=Change_this_text
REPO_NAME=Change_this_text

sudo git config --global user.email $GITHUB_EMAIL
sudo git config --global user.name $GITHUB_USERNAME
mkdir $LOCAL_DIR 2> /dev/null
cd $LOCAL_DIR
cd ..
sudo git clone $REPO_ADDRESS 2> /dev/null
sudo git config --global --add safe.directory $LOCAL_DIR
sudo chmod -R 777 $REPO_NAME
cd $LOCAL_DIR
sudo git config --global --add safe.directory $LOCAL_DIR
sudo git checkout main
sudo git reset origin/main
sudo git reset --hard HEAD
sudo git pull origin main --ff
cd ..
sudo chmod -R 777 $REPO_NAME
```

- [ ] Set `LOCAL_DIR` to the **local directory** of your repo.

- [ ] Set `REPO_NAME` to the **repository name** of your repo.

- [ ] Set `REPO_ADDRESS` to the **website address** of your repo, **followed by a `.git`**.

- [ ] Set `YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL` to the **email for your GitHub** account, and **leave the quotes** (i.e. "`alfondehesa@hotmail.com`").

- [ ] Set `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` to the **username** you use for GitHub, and **leave the quotes** (i.e. `alfondehesa`)

- [ ] `Ctrl + O` and `Enter` to **save**, and `Ctrl + X` to **close**.

## STEP 4: Add this repo to the consolidated script

- [ ] **Edit the consolidated shell script**. On the folder where you house all the repository specific shell scripts, **run**: `nano boot_main.sh`

  - [ ] At the **end of the file**, add the **following lines**:

  ```BASH
  cd path/to/your/self/hosted/runner
  sudo ./svc.sh start
  sudo sh PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SH_FILES/NAME_OF_SH_FILE_FOR_REPO_1
  ```

  - [ ] Change `path/to/your/self/hosted/runner` for the **path to your repository specific self-hosted runner** that you installed in the first step (most likely `/home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/auto_update/runners/[REPO_NAME]`).

  - [ ] Change `PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SH_FILES` for the **path of the folder where you keep all the repo specific SH scripts** (most likely `/home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/auto_update/boot_scripts`).

  - [ ] Change `NAME_OF_SH_FILE_FOR_REPO_1` for the **name of the repo specific SH script** (most likely `[REPO_NAME].sh`).

  - [ ] `Ctrl + O` and `Enter` to **save**, and `Ctrl + X` to **close**.

- [ ] Confirm everything is working, by **turning off the self-updating action** on the GitHub's website, **committing a change to main**, and **running**: `sudo sh PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SH_FILES/boot_main.sh` (most likely `sudo sh /home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/auto_update/boot_scripts/boot_main.sh`).

- [ ] Your **repository** should now be **up-to-date**.

## STEP 5: Test it out

- [ ] **Deactivate a self updating GitHub action** on the [GitHub's website](https://github.com/).

- [ ] **Unplug** your Pi.

- [ ] Make a **change** to the main branch of your repo on [GitHub's website](https://github.com/).

- [ ] **Plug in** the Pi, verify the changes are in the Pi.

- [ ] Otherwise, you might want to **check your `tmp` folder for an error log**.
