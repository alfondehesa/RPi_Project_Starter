## Summary

GitHub has a set of **really useful features to manage code**. They can all be performed either through a **command prompt (CLI)** or through **[GitHub's website](https://github.com/)**. GitHub also provides a [helpful guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) to **get started with GitHub and `git`**. Here are some **regular notions** that you should know.

### Main branch

- Your `main` branch will be the **official release** version of your code.

- You can make **changes directly** to the `main` branch.

### Commits

- Changes, in GitHub, are called **commits**.

- A **commit** is essentially a **change that was registered** within a branch in a repository.

- When working locally, changes to your files will not register until you make a **commit** (and, to update your online repo, `push` the commit).

### Branches

- If you don't want to be pushing commits directly to your `main` code, perhaps because they could be breaking changes, or you won't get to deploy a fully fledged feature in only 1 commit, your can create a **new branch out of `main`**.

- **Branches are copies of your `main` code** (or copies of other branches), that can be modified, updated and developed upon **without impacting the `main` branch**.

- Then, once your new code is ready at the branch, you can **merge this branch with your `main` branch** (you might need to resolve conflicting code between the two branches).

### Pull requests

- Once you are ready, you can also **request the admin to merge your branch** to the `main` branch, through **pull requests**.

### Forks

- If you want to work on **someone else's repo**, you can **fork their repo**, which creates a copy of their repo for you to modify.

- You can also submit a **pull request to merge your copy to the upstream repo** that you **forked**.

## Git command cheat sheet

*Here are a set of git and gh commands that you will need, if you plan to manage your project through CLI (command line).*

| Action  | Command |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Create a **new repo** | `gh repo create` |
| Clone an **existing repo** | `gh repo clone [REPO_LINK]` |
| Make a **fork of an existing repo** | `gh repo fork [REPO_LINK]` |
| **Set the working branch** in your local project | `git checkout [BRANCH_NAME]` |
| See a list of remote and local **available branches** | `git branch -a` |
| **Create a new local branch** (you will also be creating a new online upstream branch when you push this new branch) | `git branch [BRANCH_NAME]` |
| **Update a branch** with the most up-to-date version from GitHub | `git pull` OR `git pull origin [BRANCH NAME]` |
| **Add all files and changes to the index**, in order to commit | `git add .` |
| **Commit** | `git commit -m "Commit Message"` |
| **Push changes** to GitHub | `git push` |
| **Push changes** to GitHub, while linking a remote branch with a local branch | `git pull --set-upstream --allow-unrelated-histories origin [UPSTREAM_BRANCH]` |
| Directly **merging another branch into main** | ON MAIN: `git merge [name_of_branch]` |
| Create **pull request** | `gh pr create` |
| **View opened pull requests** | `gh pr view` |
| **Merge pull request** | `gh pr merge [pr_number]` |

## Next Steps

- Set up a self **updating local repository** in your Pi.

  - Go to [5.2 - Set up a self updating local repository](5.2%20-%20Set%20up%20a%20self%20updating%20local%20repository.md).

- Add a **local repository to self update** to an already set up self updating Raspberry Pi.

  - Go to [5.3 - Add a repo to self update](5.3%20-%20Add%20a%20repo%20to%20self%20update.md).

- Alternatively, you can skip the previous steps and go straight to **setting up your IDE**.

  - Go to [6 - Set up your IDE (VSC)](6%20-%20Set%20up%20your%20IDE%20(VSC).md).

- [Back to README](README.md).
